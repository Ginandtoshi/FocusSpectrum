## Ideation
After choosing a few random words based on the mechanism of SGDs game and a couple of twists and discussion, we decided combine some artist visuals but also make it practical. In our discussion, we came across the number of distraction we face in our lifes and therefore, decided to make a game out of it. 

## Mechanism
After user enters the main menu, they would do a simple calibration to make sure our tracker tracks their eye movement correctly. After calibration is completed, they can start by choosing the games they want to play. They can play them in any sequence but must complete all three of them to retrieve the final report.

## Tool used
* VScode (python, ???, ???)
    Package used
        https://pypi.org/project/pyFirmata/
        bluetooth serial

## Future Steps
1. Even though we adapted a pretty nice gaze tracking code, it is not as precise as imagined. It seems like it need to re-adjust its ratio based on different users. 
2. We are happy that our precision of gaze movement is very precise! (at least when we test it)
